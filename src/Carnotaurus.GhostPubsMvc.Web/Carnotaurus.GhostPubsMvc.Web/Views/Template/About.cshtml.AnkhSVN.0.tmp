                    <p>
                        We are chaps involved in running <a href="http://www.myPubGuide.com">myPUBGUIDE.com</a>.
    We have noticed that almost sixty public houses close each month. Therefore, given
    the success of myPUBGUIDE, we thought it would be a good idea to launch a similar
    website for drinking establishments that are haunted, closed, abandoned, and demolished.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Clearly such establishments do not belong on an active pub search. These deserve
    a special website of their own, where your contribution would be encouraged. We
    intend to launch this website in early 2013. We are sure that you have a ghost story
    to share with us about your old local.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As the name suggests Ghost Pubs we are looking for any information you can give
    regarding any hauntings or paranormal phenomena regarding your local pub.
