                    <p>Hi again,</p>
                    <p>
                        This month, our partner <a href="http://www.ghostpod.co.uk/" rel="nofollow" title="GhostPod.co.uk">GhostPod</a> shall broadcast a story from our forthcoming book, The Stockport Ellipse.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, we will not provide in-depth detail on the Ellipse in this message.  Further links will be posted when available.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All we can tell you that the book relates closely to ghostly pub experiences in the South Manchester area. It includes a lot of new material previously unheard.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The particular story in broadcast centres upon the Cotton Club, the once flagship pub for a Stockport brewery.  Active on Hillgate until the late-1950s.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's a unique ghost story that introduces the Mithered Lad, an odd spectre, to the wider world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The source is a local man who never moved from the area, and he kindly gave us an oral historical account of this ghostly entity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The local man is not a writer and does not read about supernatural events. So, his first hand account appears to be original.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Even with further research we have not found any other information on this ghost on the internet or any other resources in our vast repository.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conceding that there are a few other locals who know of the tale. This demonstrates how little known the story is but at the same time.  It helps give more credence to the story.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Indeed, it is probably safe to say that only a handful of people would have ever heard this recollection of events outside the area, until now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Kindest regards,
                    </p>
